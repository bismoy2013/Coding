You are given a sequence of N integers. The task is to find the number of continuous sequences of integers such that their sum is zero.

For example if the sequence is: 
2, -2, 6, -6, 8
There are 3 such sequences
2, -2
6, -6
2, -2, 6, -6

Input format:
The first line contains a single integer N which denotes the number of integers in the array. The next N lines contains N integers which is the sequence.

Constraints:
1<=N<=10^6   (do not forget that 10^6  squared is a big number ;) 
-10<= A[i] <= 10

Output format:
One line containing the number of sequences whose sum is zero.

Sample input:
5
2
-2
6
-6
8

Sample output:
3
